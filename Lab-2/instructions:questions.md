Comparing bash with Java
- I was successful recreating most of the program features besides the exception handling for the shell script. 
It was more difficult to process compared to Java. For example, attempting to have the file repeat after the user 
has inputted their response was a difficulty.
- A similarity between Java and Shell Scripting are their if statements and a difference would be their conditional statements.
- All it took was the read command to accept the user's input. It took around 2 lines to compute arithmetic and one
line to display the output. I still prefer Java as I am more familiar with the language, however, Shell Scripting
seems to take a lot less lines and I could be open in the future to using it.
- I didn't need to import any libraries as Shell Script already has its own commands built into the language.

Reflection on Group Exercise
- If i were to give tips I would say to first find a data set that you are interested in. Then ask yourself questions
that you feel are interesting and other people can find relatability to. Then figure out how to use the awk
and what parts of the data you want to search through. One of the main difficulties that I came across 
that I would advise to watch out for is sorting your results. Other then that, working in a group environments
makes it a lot less difficult to tackle any issues you are having.
